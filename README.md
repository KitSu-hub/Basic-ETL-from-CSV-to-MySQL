# Basic-ETL-from-CSV-to-MySQL
This project demonstrates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data engineering workflow built with Python, Pandas, and MySQL.  The pipeline extracts raw movie data from a CSV file, performs transformations such as data cleaning, deduplication, and genre extraction, and then loads the processed data into a MySQL database.
